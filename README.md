> Karektar is a web application for building exportable bitmap fonts from custom glyph sets.

https://karektar.newtrino.ink/

## Features
* Design fonts for specific use cases, without needing to build all possible glyphs.
* Utilize various tools for drawing on the canvas, from the basic pencil/eraser to shape and fill tools.
* Export fonts to an OTF format (utilizing the [opentype.js](https://github.com/opentypejs/opentype.js) library).

## Setup
* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/nishanthjayram/karektar.git`.
* Install project dependencies by running `yarn`.
* Start the development server by running `yarn dev`. (Run `yarn dev --host` to expose to other devices on your local network.)
